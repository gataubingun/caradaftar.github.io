The rest is simple: each player must either make up a sentence either choose a pre-defined, who goes next be drawn by everyone. The goal is to have the last sentence as close as possible to the last, exactly like an Arabic telephone. The funniest part is, like the original game, discover the final sentence which is nothing like the first.</p>"

Then the fourth player has to draw again to guess the sentence that the third player understood, and so on . At the end of the game, the players compare the last guessed sentence to the starting sentence , which should be as close as possible. In fact, the more players there are, the less similar the sentences will be!</p>"
